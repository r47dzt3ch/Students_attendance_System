## Setup and Usage

To use this program, you will need to have MySQL and unixODBC installed on your system. You can then download the source code and compile it using a C++ compiler of your choice.

Once compiled, you can run the program using the command-line interface. The program will prompt you to enter your MySQL username and password, after which you can start managing attendance records.
